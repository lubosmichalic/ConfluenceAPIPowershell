# Confluence API access using Powershell 

## What is it? 
PS scripts to allow access to Confluence API 

## Why do we need this? 
Automating a product release step in which we want to update the release notes of the product available on the Confluence wiki for the public with the release notes present in the repo of your choosing. 

## How do we go about this?
This is built using Pester for Testing and you can run this from your Powershell shell.
